This repository contains my projects that were implemented as part of the Web Mining course at Ben Gurion University of The Negev.  </br>
During the course I have implemented 3 projects - Web Scrapping, Document Classification, and Twitter Sentiment Classification.

---

The porjects were implemented in python 3.8, using Jupyter Notebook. 

---

## Projects
1. Web Scrapping - practice basic web scraping as well as data and basic text analysis with python.

2. Document Classification - practice text analysis and classification with python

3. Twitter Sentiment Classification - Final project based on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140">this<a> kaggle competition. The goal of the project was to practice data collection from online resources, data pre-processing and analysis to derive conclusions from the collected data.
